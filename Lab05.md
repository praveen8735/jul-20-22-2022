* Create __lab_05.go__
* Create a type __MyNumbers__ which is an array of numbers
* Create receiver functions __sum, max, min__ on MyNumbers
* If you have a MyNumbers variable say, __myCollection__, the following should be possible

``` go
mycollection.sum()
mycollection.min()
mycollection.max()
```

* Define these receiver functions and print the output on the console
* You can use these numbers 10, 200, 34, 78, 9
