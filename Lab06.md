* Create __lab_06.go__
* Create a global array of numbers 101, 22, 43, 14, 5, 906, 310, 561, 84, 23, 100

<br/>

### Part I

* Create a higher order function called __find__  with the following spec.
* __find__ returns an array of numbers
* __find__ takes one argument say __arg__ which takes a number and returns a boolean
* __find__ iterates the array and applies __arg__ on each item and returns the array of numbers as result

* From __main()__ call __find__ and 

* generate a list of even numbers
* generate a list of odd numbers
* Generate a list of numbers divisible by 5. 

<br/>

### Part II

* Create a higher order function called __compute__  that will iterate the array and apply the __arg__ and return a number as a result

* From __main()__ call __compute__ and 

* Find the sum of square of all numbers
* Find the sum of cube of all numbers
